        <h2>About Doogle</h2>
        <p>
            Doogle LLC is an American multinational technology company focusing on online advertising, search engine
            technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and
            consumer electronics. It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world and one of the
            world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in
            the area of artificial intelligence.Its parent company Alphabet is considered one of the Big Five American
            information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.

            Doogle was founded on September 4, 1998, by computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were
            PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares
            and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an
            initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Doogle was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of
            Alphabet Inc. Doogle is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet
            properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry
            Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.<br><br>
            The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Doogle Search, many
            of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email
            (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube),
            productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation
            (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable
            technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial
            intelligence (Google Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued
            Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by
            Gmail.

            Doogle's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing
            (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Doogle Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk
            Labs), and transformer models (Doogle Brain).

            Doogle and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Doogle is
            also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video
            sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and
            AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands,
            Doogle is ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.It has received significant criticism
            involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse
            of its monopoly position<br><br></p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Doogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD
            students at Stanford University in California.The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder",
            Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Doogle Search engine,
            but he left before Doogle was officially founded as a company;Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics
            and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.<br><br>
            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the
            page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.They called this
            algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those
            pages that linked back to the original site.Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to
            implement Page's ideas.

            Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to
            estimate the importance of a site.Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being
            critical to the development of Doogle. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and
            Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Doogle search
            engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the
            project.PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for
            RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's
            earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.<br><br>
